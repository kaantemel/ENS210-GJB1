  Mutation: WT+POS+NEW
    WT: Residue in wild-type protein
    POS: Residue position
    NEW: New residue after mutation
  Prediction:
    Neutral: Neutral variants
    Disease: Disease causing variants
  Outputs: Value reported under each prediction
    PANTHER: Between 0 and 1. (If >0.5 mutation is predicted Disease)
    PhD-SNP: Between 0 and 1. (If >0.5 mutation is predicted Disease)
    SIFT: Positive Value (If >0.05 mutation is predicted Neutral)
    SNAP: Output normailzed between 0 and 1 (If >0.5 mutation is predicted Disease)
    Meta-SNP: Between 0 and 1. (If >0.5 mutation is predicted Disease)
  RI: Reliability Index between 0 an 10
  F[X]: Frequency of residue X in the sequence profile
  Nali: Number of aligned sequences in the mutated site
